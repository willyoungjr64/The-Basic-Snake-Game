# The Basic Snake Game
This basic snake game was created to help myself learn C++
The snake can be moved using the "WASD" style of movement
The score goes up by 1 point each time a 'fruit' is eaten and the snake gains one extra session
The game ends and closes if the snake's head touches any part of it's body
